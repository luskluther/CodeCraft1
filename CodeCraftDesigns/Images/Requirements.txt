The backend is selected as asp.net and related database
Front end is selected as angular single page application
The designs show that there is a landing page when the website is run , after login page and when each of the tile is clicked page and signup page and profile page
First user has to login on signup
The tiles are described in the clicked page and all this data is stored in data structures , algorithms and description page so when new data structure or algorithm needs to be added it can be done from the database
User data and authentication also needs to be done basd on form and password must be hashed and stored in the database
user needs to be given random icon avatar from fonts library for ring in profile which can be later changed with different avatars
the profile page show what all i finished which will be a checkbox in the tile clicked page
The relevant data for the other tiles needs to be generated by you
We can first start with all static and make it database later if required or in one shot
